# Solar Flare

his code uses the Python Turtle library to create a stunning, colorful pattern that appears to swirl and burst like a solar flare. The pattern is formed by drawing a series of connected circles with decreasing radii, with each circle being drawn in a different color from the colors list. The hideturtle() function is used to hide the turtle, making the pattern more visually appealing.

# Features
Vibrant colors: The pattern features bright, vibrant colors that evoke the intense energy of a solar flare.
Swirling motion: The circles are drawn with a left turn of 200 degrees, creating a sense of swirling motion and dynamic energy.
Decreasing radii: The decreasing radii of the circles create a sense of depth and dimensionality, adding to the overall visual impact.


# Run
To run this code, save it to a file with a .py extension (e.g., solar_flare.py) and execute it using Python (e.g., python solar_flare.py). This will launch a window displaying the Solar Flare pattern.
